<p><strong>Hey everyone!</strong> I'm working hard to get your iPads ready. In the mean time, I have two mini-projects that you should be working on. Both are due in the first week of October. We'll go into more specifics on how to submit your work then. Click below to find out more.</p>

<p>This page is constantly changing. It's your job to keep up to date and check in regularly. We only meet once a week, so it's really important that you stay on top of things. If you have <em>any questions whatsoever</em>, please email me.</p>
