<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Students will create a presentation in Google Docs that shows their knowledge in one component of the computer, name it in an appropriate fashion, share it with the teacher.</p>

<h2 id="activity">Activity</h2>

<p>In order to become really awesome with computers, we have to know how they work. Next week, we&#8217;re going to go into a lot of detail on each part of a computer and what it does. This week, you&#8217;re going to do some preliminary research.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be using the presentations in Google Docs (you covered this with Ms. Deruvo last year) to share your work.</p>

<p>Choose one computer component that you want to learn more about:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Hard Drive</li>
<li>The Processor</li>
<li>RAM</li>
<li>Motherboard</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the web to research your component.</p>

<p>Your mission is to create 5 slides in your presentation. You can use as many slides as you need if five is not enough for you.</p>

<ol>
<li>The name of the component you&#8217;re looking at and all of the members in your group.</li>
<li>A description of what the component does.</li>
<li>A detailed description of how the component works (you can use more than one slide if you need to).</li>
<li>An explanation of why it&#8217;s important to the computer.</li>
<li>An example of one you would recommend purchasing.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>When is Wikipedia a good resource for information and when is it a questionable resource?</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got some good news and some bad news about Wikipedia: anyone can edit it. That&#8217;s right; that&#8217;s the good news <em>as well as</em> the bad. Anyone can edit it with false information. At the same time, any of the millions of eyes that spot that false information can easily correct it. Try that with a printed Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is good when you&#8217;re dealing with object, known facts.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is questionable when you&#8217;re dealing with controversial or extremely current topics.</li>
</ul>

<p>How a hard drive works is not really something that&#8217;s up for debate. On the other hand, something like global warming or Barack Obama&#8217;s (or even George W. Bush&#8217;s) presidency is something that people have strong opinions on and are likely to let those opinions color their explanation of the facts.</p>

<p>Other examples of questionable resources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anyone trying to sell you something.</li>
<li>Personal web pages, blogs, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying either are badâ€”and we&#8217;ll be using some of each for our research project. I&#8217;m suggesting, however, that you take what you read with a grain of salt.</p>

<p><strong>Rubric</strong>: Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=13QAGXdw9JYPLXDk4xDHskZzx3pa9BCwfCVClefSodrA">link to a rubric</a> that you can use to judge whether or not your presentation is awesome. <em>Ignore the row titled &#8220;Cooperative Work&#8221; as you will be working on this independently today.</em></p>
