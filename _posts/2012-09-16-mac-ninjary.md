In case you haven't noticed, the Scholars' Academy has a lot of computers. In addition, a fair number of those computers run Mac OS X (the most popular operating system in the school is iOS, in case you were wondering). It's worth getting comfortable with Mac OS X. You can do a lot of really cool stuff with it. More importantly, if you are going to be stuck in front of it for the next few years, you might as well be able to work quickly and efficiently with it.

## Your Mission

Create a short tutorial on a Mac ninja move that you think will help your classmates. The format is up to you. It could be a Google Doc. It could be a presentation. It could be a screencast. It could be a web page. It could be anything.

You know I love a good rubric, but this assignment is going to be a bit more freeform. Here is a list of targets you should be aiming to hit.

* You ninja move should be something that anyone can use.
* It should be something that helps people on a regular basis.
* It should be easy to do.
* It should not require any special software.
* It should work on Mac OS X 10.7 and later.
* It should be something that you could teach one of your teachers.

**Super challenge**: I used to work for Apple. I got my first Mac in 1992. If you teach me something that I didn't know, I will buy pizza for you and your entire class. Be warned: No one has ever accomplished this. (Fine print: It needs to meet _all_ of the above criteriaâ€”but replace "should" with "must.")

## How to Take a Screenshot

Good tutorials have lots of pictures. Your tutorial should not be an exception. So, how do you take a screenshot? It's _really_ easy on a Mac.

* To take a screenshot of your entire screen, press `Command-Shift-3`.
* To take a screenshot of a certain area of your screen, press `Command-Shift-4`. This will give you some crosshairs. Click and drag and your Mac will take a shot of the area you have selected.
* To take a screenshot of one window, press `Command-Shift-4`. You'll get the crosshairs. Now, press `space`.

## How to Record a Screencast

What if a still picture won't cut it? Well, then you can record your screen. It's magic. Let's [let a younger version of myself explain the process with a screencast][vimeo] (crazy, right?).

Here are some links to point you in the right direction. That said, the smart student will take a close look at the keyboard shortcuts and poke around in System Preferences in order to uncover some hidden gems.

## Submitting Your Project

Due to the fact that I have to keep track of close to 300 students, I have really specific ways that I need stuff submitted to me. We'll go over this in class together. Depending on how you put your project together, you're method may vary slightly. That's totally cool. Part of the reason that we're doing these mini-projects in the beginning of the year is to work out all of the kinks.
