**Nota bene**: It's usually a good idea to check out the [rubric][] when you start on a project in order to make sure you're heading in the right direction. Rubrics—check them early and check them often.

## Introduction ##

In order to become really awesome with computers, we have to know how they work. If we haven't already (I've seen some of you more than others), we’re going to go into a lot of detail on each part of a computer and what it does. This week, you’re going to do some preliminary research.

You can use the presentations in Google Docs (you covered this with Ms. Deruvo last year) to share your work. I'll give bonus points to anyone who comes up with an awesome and creative way to share what they've learned. Take a look a [Prezi][] when you have some free time.

[Prezi]: http://prezi.com

Choose one computer component that you want to learn more about:

* Hard disk
* RAM
* Motherboard
* Processor

We're going to be doing some web research in order to learn more about the components.

You're project is going to have three phases. Click your next step to stroll to the instructions.

1. [Research](#research)
2. [Presentation Creation](#presentation)
3. Presentation Recording (We'll get to this soon)

## Research ##

You should begin by doing some basic research:

* What does the component do for the computer?
* Would the computer be able to function without this component? Why or why not?
* How does the component work?
* What should I be looking at if I want to buy one?

You should have three or four bullet points for each of the questions above. Make sure that you are keeping track of the website where you found your information—you'll need to site them later.

[Can you use Wikipedia?](/readings/trusting-wikipedia.html)

### Reflection on Your Research ###

* How useful was the information you found on Wikipedia for your research topic?
* Did you find any other good resources?
* What topics do you need to research next week?

## Presentation ##

I care that you learn the material and that your presentation is awesome. I also care that you meet the requirements of the [rubric][]. Beyond that, you're free to use whatever tool you want (e.g. Google Docs, PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi).

At one point, we'll need a way to get it onto the web, but we'll burn that bridge when we get to it.

Your mission is to create 5 components in your presentation. You can use as many slides as you need.

1. The name of the component you're looking at and your name.
2. A description of what the component does.
3. A detailed description of how the component works (you can use more than one slide if you need to).
4. An explanation of why it's important to the computer.
5. An example of one you would recommend purchasing.

### Is this good? ###

I'm really glad you're concerned with the quality of your work. That makes me really happy. There is a [rubric][]. Feel free to take a look at it. Follow the column labeled "4" if you want to earn a great grade!
