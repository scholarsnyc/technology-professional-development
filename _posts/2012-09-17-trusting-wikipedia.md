How do we evaluate whether or not information on the Internet is valid and relevant? It should be noted that this is a multi-part, in-depth question. We want to tease out one aspect of it.

_When is Wikipedia a good resource for information and when is it a questionable resource?_

I've got some good news and some bad news about Wikipedia: anyone can edit it. That's right; that's the good news _as well as_ the bad. Anyone can edit it with false information. At the same time, any of the millions of eyes that spot that false information can easily correct it. Try that with a printed Encyclopedia Britannica.

* Wikipedia is good when you're dealing with object, known facts.
* Wikipedia is questionable when you're dealing with controversial or extremely current topics.

How a hard drive works is not really something that's up for debate. On the other hand, topics like global warming or a politician is something that people have strong opinions on and are likely to let those opinions color their explanation of the facts.

Other examples of questionable resources:

* Anyone trying to sell you something.
* Personal web pages, blogs, etc.

I'm not saying either are badâ€”and we'll be using some of each for our research project. I'm suggesting, however, that you take what you read with a grain of salt.
