In case you haven't noticed, the Scholars' Academy has a lot of computers. In addition, a fair number of those computers run Mac OS X (the most popular operating system in the school is iOS, in case you were wondering). It's worth getting comfortable with Mac OS X. You can do a lot of really cool stuff with it. More importantly, if you are going to be stuck in front of it for the next few years, you might as well be able to work quickly and efficiently with it.

## How to Take a Screenshot

Good tutorials have lots of pictures. Your tutorial should not be an exception. So, how do you take a screenshot? It's _really_ easy on a Mac.

* To take a screenshot of your entire screen, press `Command-Shift-3`.
* To take a screenshot of a certain area of your screen, press `Command-Shift-4`. This will give you some crosshairs. Click and drag and your Mac will take a shot of the area you have selected.
* To take a screenshot of one window, press `Command-Shift-4`. You'll get the crosshairs. Now, press `space`.

## How to Record a Screencast

What if a still picture won't cut it? Well, then you can record your screen. It's magic. Let's [let a younger version of myself explain the process with a screencast][vimeo] (crazy, right?).
